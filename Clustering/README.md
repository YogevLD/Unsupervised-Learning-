# Clustering Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the application of clustering techniques using Python and various libraries. It includes reading datasets directly from GitHub, applying clustering algorithms, and visualizing the results. The notebook is designed to be educational, with references to external resources for those seeking deeper explanations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Libraries Used

- `sklearn` for clustering algorithms and metrics
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `scipy` for visualizations
- `requests` for fetching datasets
- `collections` for data structure support

### Setup Instructions

Install required Python libraries:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib scipy requests
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Clustering_task.ipynb

# Project Overview
Read the file from GitHub: Demonstrates how to fetch and read datasets for clustering analysis.
Clustering Algorithms: Utilizes AgglomerativeClustering and KMeans from sklearn to perform clustering.
Visualization: Uses matplotlib and scipy for plotting dendrograms and cluster distributions.
Evaluation: Applies silhouette score to assess the effectiveness of clustering.
