# Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of various unsupervised learning algorithms. Below are the projects included:

## Clustering Algorithms

### 1. Hierarchical Clustering

Description: Implementation of hierarchical clustering methods, such as agglomerative and divisive clustering, for grouping data points into hierarchical clusters.

### 2. K-Means Clustering

Description: Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm, which partitions data into K clusters by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updating centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.
