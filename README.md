# Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of various unsupervised learning algorithms. Below are the projects included:

## Gradient Descent Variants

### 1. Batch Gradient Descent

Description: Implementation of the batch gradient descent algorithm for optimizing machine learning models.

### 2. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Description: Implementation of the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm, which balances efficiency and convergence speed by updating model parameters on small random subsets of the training data.

### 3. Stochastic Gradient Descent

Description: Implementation of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which updates model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function computed on a single training example.

## Clustering Algorithms

### 1. Hierarchical Clustering

Description: Implementation of hierarchical clustering methods, such as agglomerative and divisive clustering, for grouping data points into hierarchical clusters.

### 2. K-Means Clustering

Description: Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm, which partitions data into K clusters by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updating centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.
